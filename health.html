              <h2>Preventive Health Care Measures</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Preventive health care measures are actions taken to reduce the risk of developing diseases or health problems and to promote overall well-being. The goal is to prevent health issues before they arise, rather than treating them once they’ve already occurred. Preventive care is crucial in helping individuals live longer, healthier lives. Here are some common preventive health care measures:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Regular Health Check-ups</b>:Routine visits to your healthcare provider can help catch potential health issues early.During these visits, doctors can screen for conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol issues, even before symptoms show up.</li>
                <li><b>Vaccinations (Immunizations)</b>:Vaccines protect you from contagious diseases, some of which can lead to serious health complications or death. Keeping up with recommended immunizations helps protect both the individual and the broader community.</li>
                <li><b>Healthy Diet</b>:Eating a balanced and nutritious diet supports your body’s overall health and prevents many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.</li>
                <li><b>Physical Activity (Exercise)</b>: Regular physical activity can prevent or manage chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It also boosts mental health by reducing stress and improving mood.</li>
                <li><b>Avoiding Smoking and Limiting Alcohol</b>: Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases like lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory conditions. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver disease, addiction, and increased risk of accidents.</li>
